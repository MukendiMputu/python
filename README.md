## Learning the Python programming language
The purpos of this repo to me is to learn python by building and learning about the Blockchain technology as well as about Cryptocorrency, which is the prominent implementation of that technology.

## Materials
I'll be using multiple learning platforms to dive into the basics of Python such as ['LinkedIn learning'](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) (former [Lynda.com](www.lynda.com)), [Eduonix](https://www.eduonix.com/) and Udacity. Not everyone of thoses platforms are free, so if you wish to visit or watch those courses, you might have to subscribe or/and pay some fee.

### General outlines
Basically all the courses throughout those platforms have the following course outlines:
1. Getting Started

   includes [install python](https://www.python.org/) and learning about the different versions;
2. Diving Into the Basics of Python
3. Working with Loops & Conditionals
4. Understanding Complex Data Structures
5. Working with Functions & Strings
6. Working the Python Standard Library
7. Working with Files
8. Handling Errors & Debugging
9. Object Oriented Programming
10. Modules
11. Adding HTTP with Flask
12. The Node Network
13. Next Steps and Course Roundup

There are many source of information online in case you want to start a learning path on your own. The list above is certainly not complete, but it is a little for you to know where to start.

### Blockchain Status
Throughout the course in Eudonix the following overview of building a blockchain cryptocurrency was provided:
- Chain of Data: basic implementation
- Mine new Blocks: asking for user input (new transactions)
- Block Hashing:
- Analyze & verify chain:
- Real Transactions:
- Store chain to Disk
- Node network:
- Share Data, Resolve conflicts:
- Wallets:
