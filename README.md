## Learning the Python programming language
The purpos of this repo to me is to learn python by building and learning about the Blockchain technology as well as about Cryptocorrency, which is the prominent implementation of that technology.

## Materials
I'll be using multiple learning platforms to dive into the basics of Python such as ['LinkedIn learning'](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) (former [Lynda.com](www.lynda.com)), [Eduonix](https://www.eduonix.com/) and Udacity. Not everyone of thoses platforms are free, so if you wish to visit or watch those courses, you might have to subscribe or/and pay some fee.

### General outlines
Basically all the courses throughout those platforms have the following course outlines: 
1. Getting Started <br>
